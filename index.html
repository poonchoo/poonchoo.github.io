         <p>
           I have studied various subjects during my time at the UW, including design, coding,
           machine learning, and many more. From my major I have focused on cognitive psychology,
           sensation and perception pathways of the brain, and industrial organizational psychology.
           also learned how to read and <a href="#research">summarize research papers</a>.
